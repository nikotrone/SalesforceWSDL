# SalesforceWSDL
## WSDL files generated for out of the box Developer Org

Salesforce is one of the most used CRM platforms in the market. It is widely used and the developer community is growing every year.

Some developers, for work or for hobby, decide to create applications and tools that integrates with the Salesforce platform.
In order to write such applications you often need the WSDL definitions of the SOAP objects and methods supported, which is only available to generate and download from INSIDE an organization.

To overcome this inconvenience the suggested workaround is to create a free developer organization from https://developer.salesforce.com/

I find this process a bit inconvenient and annoying, so I decided to generate one of each WSDL definitions from a newly created  developer organization and put it for everyone to use (me included).

This way you can always inspect, download.
